# Remote-Control-Obstacle-avoider-and-fall-safe-System
Around 4.5Lakhs accidents happen annually in India out of which 1.5Lakh people die.Hence here we have tried to build a prototype to try and avoid accidents with the help of  Arduino UNO and few other sensors and components. It is a remote controlled to simulate the effect of driving.

Here's a demo of how it works.
